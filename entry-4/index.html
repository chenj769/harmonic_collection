          The layout is the first step to creating Genga 原画 or Key Animation. An animation layout contains the rough animation which is drawn in accordance to the E-konte. Information about camerawork or instructions to compositors are commonly featured on the Layout. The layout also contains a timesheet タイムシート that the animator will fill out. Timesheets account for every frame, camerawork directions and sound. After the layout is submitted, a series of checks and corrections is done by either: 
          <span class="Checks">
            <ol> 
                <li>Episode Director 演出, Enshutsu </li>
                <li>Director 監督, Kantoku</li>
                <li>Sakuga Director 作画監督, sakuga kantoku</li>
                <li>Chief Sakuga Director 総作画監督, Sou Sakuga Kantoku </li>
                The Chief Sakuga Director is also usually the Character designer and has the final say. 
            </ol>

            Genga is the Key Animation, where it consists of Layout and Tiedown. The animation work is created in Layout and the corrections are applied and tied-down drawings are made.
