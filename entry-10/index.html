        <div class="Border1"> Before wrapping everything up, I must mention the Japanese anime industry’s ongoing issues with poor working conditions. Overwork, low living wages, and abuse are so commonly prevalent in anime productions. A NAFCA (The Nippon Anime & Film Culture Association) survey found that animators worked over 225 hours a month, many earning less than 16,000 USD annually. 
        <br> <br>
	    At the time of writing this (November 2025) the airing of the long awaited franchise One Punch Man Season 3 is going on. Harassment and verbal abuse has been thrown towards the director and animators working on the project for its lackluster and disappointing deliverable. This whole situation is being exacerbated by large misconceptions people have about the industry. The belief that the visual quality of an anime lies solely at the animators or the animation studio’s hands is one common misconception. The general public unaware of anime production opt to blame the staff instead of what is largely at fault, the production committee. Nowadays, production committees and corporate greed have encouraged and pushed quantity over quality. Production for OPM3 didn’t start until early 2025, the team has had only 6 - 7 months to produce the season. With such impossible deadlines, realistically no studio could deliver top-tier quality. 
        <br> <br> 
        This type of thing happens all the time in the industry, it just took a highly anticipated show like One Punch Man to reveal it. The reaction from fans and the public is incredibly disrespectful and amounts to nothing. Harassing the staff and dehumanizing them as resources is just plain sad to see and shows a genuine lack of understanding. 
        <br> <br> 
        I hope this harmonic collection has helped in providing awareness to the anime production pipeline and the importance behind the Sakuga community. Whether you want to delve deeper into Sakuga or not, I want to make an important point that sakuga isn’t just liking animation but having a holistic look towards all the forces involved in making animation. 
        <br> <br> 
        To end it off, I'm including an excerpt from an incredible article written by Kevin Cirugeda, <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2015-09-30/the-joy-of-sakuga/.93579" target="_blank">“The Joy of Sakuga”</a>. If you’d like a more complete introduction to the meaning, concept and community behind Sakuga, this article is the place to go.

        <div class="Excerpt">"It's crucial to realize why even care about the names of those animators. From an outsider's perspective it might feel like worship of individuals rather than passion for impressive artistic work, but you have to take into account those peculiarities of the anime industry; by allowing the personal style of key animators to leak strongly into the work, they create a situation in which fans can easily find and identify the kind of art they are fond of. Knowing someone whose style you love is involved with a show can be a strong hint that it will have scenes you will fancy, and recognizing names in the staff list is a good way to find out who was in charge of that one bit that impressed you. People don't follow animators because they're looking for idols to worship, they do it because they enjoy those artistic voices that anime allows to be heard. It's not about the names, but what those names represent does matter.
        <br> <br>
        There is a prevalent attitude amongst anime fans to obsess over the studio in charge of a show, which ignores the realities of the industry and sometimes borders unhealthiness and plain disrespect. The truth is that save for very few exceptions, anime is the work of freelancers and outsourced animators; even the core staff of TV anime and movies is often composed by people who don't belong to the company, so making judgments based on that is unreliable at best. It's obviously easier to attach an opinion to a brand name than tracking individual performances, but generalizations often based on misconceptions help no one. If you're going to honor impressive work, credit the actual artists who made it. This isn't to say that studios aren't a factor – in-house talent still exists, working conditions differ, and different producers tackle projects in their own way. If you want to see why a certain anime looks the way it does however, pay attention to the actual names of the creators. Not because of the names themselves, but the people behind them. They matter."
