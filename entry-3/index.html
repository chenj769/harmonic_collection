        <div class="Border1">Every animation begins with a concept. A concept can be a director’s original idea compiled in a pitch-package, or an adaption of an existing IP (Manga, Novel, Game, etc) . The pre-production phase consists of planning (Kikaku), scripting (Scenario), design sheets (Settei), and finally storyboards (E-konte). 
        <span class="Terminology">Kikaku 企画 (Planning)</span>
          A production committee 制作委員会 is created to facilitate the planning and production of the new anime. The committee is composed of various production companies, broadcasters, publishers, and sponsors. The committee will figure out the scope of the show, the staff and cast, and provide funding. 
          <span class="Terminology">Screenplay シナリオ (Script)</span>
          The screenplay or script is written by a dedicated writer or sometimes the director 監督. There will be plenty of meetings between the directors and writers to perfect the script. Like western scripts, they provide information on place, time, action, movement, etc.
