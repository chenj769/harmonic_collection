            <div class="Terminology">Layout レイアウト</div>
            <br>
            The layout is the first step to creating Genga 原画 or Key Animation. An animation layout contains the rough animation which is drawn in accordance to the E-konte. Information about camerawork or instructions to compositors are commonly featured on the Layout. The layout also contains a timesheet タイムシート that the animator will fill out. Timesheets account for every frame, camerawork directions and sound. After the layout is submitted, a series of checks and corrections is done by either: 
            <br> <br>
            <span class="Checks">
            <ol> 
                <li>Episode Director 演出, Enshutsu </li>
                <li>Director 監督, Kantoku</li>
                <li>Sakuga Director 作画監督, Sakuga kantoku</li>
                <li>Chief Sakuga Director 総作画監督, Sou Sakuga Kantoku</li>
            </ol>
            <br> 
            The Chief Sakuga Director is also usually the Character designer and has the final say.

            <div class="Terminology">Genga 原画</div>
            <br>
            Genga is the Key Animation, where it consists of Layout and Tiedown. The animation work is created in Layout and the corrections are applied and tied-down drawings are made. 
            The stage when tied-down drawings are made is called Nigen 二元 or Second Key Animation. Nigen is common in busy productions with hectic schedules. Another series of checks will be done, and finally, all the drawings will be collected in the Cut bag カット袋. 
            <br> <br>
            <div class="Terminology">Douga 動画</div>
            <br>
            Douga is a common word that means “video” in Japanese. In animation, Douga is the process of drawing the Inbetweens (Nakawari, 中割り) based off the timing charts in the layout. It is finally sent to a Douga checker to make sure the drawings have no errors. The inbetweens complete the Genga and make the final lines in the anime. Douga is usually done in a separate Douga studio. 
            <br> <br> 
            <div class="Terminology">Shiage 仕上げ</div>
            <br>
            Shiage is the Japanese word for finishing or final work. Shiage is when each individual frame is cell-painted according to the color design. 
            <br> <br> 
            <div class="Terminology">Bijutsu 美術</div>
            <br>
            The bijutsu, or background department paints backgrounds usually after the Layouts are complete. 
            <br><br>
            <div class="Terminology">3DCG</div>
            <br>
            The 3DCG department generally helps out all other departments when needed. They can create mockups or models to help out animators, create textures or effects for compositors and of course create 3D Animation when needed.
