        <div class="Border1">Now that we have a general grasp of the Japanese animation pipeline, we can start looking into Sakuga and its integration into the anime fandom. Sakuga refers to a certain kind of way to watch and appreciate animation—the evolution of this appreciation is integral to the anime fandom, motivating and inspiring fans in new ways to enjoy and study the medium. 
        <br> <br>
        This section will look at the birth of sakuga. How, when and why did anime fans start to take an interest in the actual people making the animation? It’s surprisingly straightforward actually. In the early 80s Japan saw the appearance of a new word in anime lingo.  カリスマアニメーター, or <em> karisuma animeta </em> (charisma animator), an animator whose animation isn’t simply good, but stands out to a point where that his style is distinctly recognizable. 
        <br> <br>   
        This figure is represented by one who is considered the most influential and important Japanese animator ever, Yoshinari Kanada. Without getting into too much detail about Kanada (He will be the topic of the next entry!) His animation style with dynamic poses, thick linework, unique timing, and endless creativity made his participation in episodes one of a kind. His work simply stands out so far apart from the rest of the show and TV animation at the time. 
        <br> <br>
        Eventually, Kanada became impossible to ignore. His individual style would continue popping up in outstanding episodes and fans would become familiar with his name. His popularity even spread to official magazines like <em>Animage</em> and he was one of the first animators to have an artbook published after himself.  
        <br> <br> 
        Kanada’s popularity was a demonstration of a new look towards animation and the rise of individualism within animators. His influence would give rise to other outstanding animators like Ichirou Itano, who developed the techniques behind “Itano Circus”. This popularization of terms tied to an animator's quirks like the <u>Itano Circus</u>, or the <u>Kanada Dragon</u> to more modern ones like <u>Yutapon Cubes</u> share an awareness of the artist behind the work. It reinforced the idea that each of these animators had a distinct style and quirk, encouraging people to look more into them. 
        <br> <br> 
        The next few entries will look at two outstanding animators whose work has generated a whole generation of Sakuga fans and aspiring animators: <strong>Yutaka Nakamura</strong> and <strong>Shinya Ohira</strong>.
