        <div class="Border1"> Shinya Ohira is probably one of the most unconventional Japanese animators. His animation is characterized by rule-breaking qualities in the industry, often going off-model and featuring his signature “morph-like”, loose and deforming visuals. People often associate the term expressionism with Ohira’s work. His focus lies on a truly visceral and vivid portrayal of movement in animation. His sequences literally do not ever stop moving. 
        <br> <br>
	    His pursuits of interesting and engaging animation first started with his fascinations with effects animation: explosions, smoke, clouds, laser beams. He would depict those effects with lively fluidity and looseness. His style came to fruition when he started to apply those very organic and vivid senses of movements to solid objects—humans. His earliest application of this is in episode 10 of Hakkenden (1994). Shinya’s animated characters would change physical shape and appearance every frame, “morphing” and never being solid. His character animation began to be animated as it were animating a special effect. 
        <br> <br> 
        This would become his trademark but there of course were some trade offs. Ohira’s drawings were almost too distinct, they would usually break the style of a project, his sequences were challenging for inbetweeners and his work might not fit every director’s goals. Sometimes this meant his sequences had to be heavily corrected. “Yet certain projects need Ohira. Without his style, there are moments that can’t happen. Only he can draw them.” (Animation Obsessive Substack). This sentiment is shared by renown Hayao Miyazaki, who has worked with Ohira on his films since <em>Porco Rosso</em> (1992). Miyazaki <em>wanted Ohira's</em> unique style — only he could draw these things. (Animation Obsessive).

        Ohira is an exception in the industry through and through, but a prime example of the creative possibilities that can be found in the heart and medium of Japanese animation. This year, Ohira was able to direct a short film <em>Black</em> that is the culmination of his style. A film that never stops moving. It's a piece of work bringing in fans-turned-animators of Ohira (who are mostly foreign animators) that display the same qualities of sheer rawness, enthusiasm and power that Ohira has chased in his own drawings. <em>Black</em> is a work that has evolved both Ohira and a new generation of young animators that follow his footsteps.
