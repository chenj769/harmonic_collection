        Why is Nakamura so popular? With just one look at Nakamura’s sequences you could probably tell why. He's renowned for his detailed and fluid action animation to his shift in style incorporating 2D effects animation. His work is bombastic, always breaking barriers, evolving, and influencing other animators. He is considered anime’s most influential action animator. The famous “Yutapon cubes” (Cube shaped debris) and Nakamura impact frames are trademarked around his name and style. Whenever Nakamura shows up, it's always a surprise to see how he is continuously inventing, reiterating, and improving on his style and animation. He is an animator who people look forward to not because of his past sequences, but with anticipation of what he’ll do next.
