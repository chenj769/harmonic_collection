        <div class="Border1">Sakuga is a word that simply means animation in Japanese, but it has been used by fans overseas often referring to good animation, impressive motion, animation that stands out. These are all vague terms that point out a awareness that there’s an increase in animation quality. But Sakuga is not just the things that move on the screen or appreciating the visual glamor of animation.
            <br> <br> It’s the idea that there is deliberate intention in the movement that makes the animation remarkable. The first kanji in sakuga (作画), means “to make, to craft”. So when anime fans refer to sakuga, it means not just appreciating animation as the visual movement, but also considering the work that has been made to create the movement. Sakuga is the awareness of what goes on behind the scenes, the process and practice of creating animation.
            <br> <br> This Harmonic Collection will aim to educate and inform viewers on the process of anime production while sharing my favorite aspects of the medium of anime within the sakuga perspective. <div>
