        <div class="Border1">Every animation begins with a concept. A concept can be a director’s original idea compiled in a pitch-package, or an adaption of an existing IP (Manga, Novel, Game, etc). The pre-production phase consists of planning (Kikaku), scripting (Scenario), design sheets (Settei), and finally storyboards (E-konte).

            A production committee 制作委員会 is created to facilitate the planning and production of the new anime. The committee is composed of various production companies, broadcasters, publishers, and sponsors. The committee will figure out the scope of the show, the staff and cast, and provide funding.

            <br>
            The screenplay or script is written by a dedicated writer or sometimes the director 監督. There will be plenty of meetings between the directors and writers to perfect the script. Like western scripts, they provide information on place, time, action, movement, etc.

            <br> 
            Settei is the Japanese term for model sheets or character sheets. Characters, environments, and objects will be drawn on the sheets which will be mass-copied and distributed to animators to use as reference material. The Settei will inform how and what you draw. 
            <br> <br> 
            <div class="Terminology">E-konte 絵コンテ (Storyboards)</div>
            <br> 
            E-konte is the Japanese term referring to storyboards, a visualization of the script. Scenes and movements are drawn out and notes are written. Writers and storyboard artists will work closely together. Storyboard artists can be the director themselves or delegated to Episode directors 演出, who are in charge of individual episodes. 
            <br> <br>
            Because E-konte are created by the director or a small team of storyboard artists, they are full of personal style. E-konte are normally messier or rough, because it is drawn fast and expected for animators to give their own interpretations of the scene. Although, some directors like Hayao Miyazaki and Satoshi Kon are renowned for their extremely detailed e-konte.

            This is the last part of pre-production.
