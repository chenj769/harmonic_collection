<h2> 
  PRE-PRODUCTION
</h2>
  <p>Every animation begins with a concept. A concept can be a director’s original idea compiled in a pitch-package, or an adaption of an existing IP (Manga, Novel, Game, etc) . The pre-production phase consists of planning (Kikaku), scripting (Scenario), design sheets (Settei), and finally storyboards (E-konte). 
 </p>
<div> 
  <h3> 
    <!-- TERMINOLOGY STUFF -->
    KIKAKU 企画 (PLANNING)
  </h3>
  <p> A production committee 制作委員会 is created to facilitate the planning and production of the new anime. The committee is composed of various production companies, broadcasters, publishers, and sponsors. The committee will figure out the scope of the show, the staff and cast, and provide funding. 
</p>
  <h3> 
  SCREENPLAY シナリオ (SCRIPT)  
</h3>
  <p> The screenplay or script is written by a dedicated writer or sometimes the director 監督. There will be plenty of meetings between the directors and writers to perfect the script. Like western scripts, they provide information on place, time, action, movement, etc. 
</p>
  <h3> 
    SETTEI 設定 (DESIGN)
  </h3> 
  <p> Settei is the Japanese term for model sheets or character sheets. Characters, environments, and objects will be drawn on the sheets which will be mass-copied and distributed to animators to use as reference material. The Settei will inform how and what you draw. 
</p> 
<h3> 
  E-konte 絵コンテ (STORYBOARDS)
</h3>
<p> E-konte is the Japanese term referring to storyboards, a visualization of the script. Scenes and movements are drawn out and notes are written. Writers and storyboard artists will work closely together. Storyboard artists can be the director themselves or delegated to Episode directors 演出, who are in charge of individual episodes. <br>
<br> Because E-konte are created by the director or a small team of storyboard artists, they are full of personal style. E-konte are normally messier or rough, because it is drawn fast and expected for animators to give their own interpretations of the scene. Although, some directors like Hayao Miyazaki and Satoshi Kon are renowned for their extremely detailed e-konte. <br>
<br> This is the last part of pre-production. 
</p>
</div> 
<h2>
  PRODUCTION 
</h2>
<h3>
   LAYOUT レイアウト 
</h3>
<p> 
The layout is the first step to creating Genga 原画 or Key Animation. An animation layout contains the rough animation which is drawn in accordance to the E-konte. Information about camerawork or instructions to compositors are commonly featured on the Layout. The layout also contains a timesheet タイムシート that the animator will fill out. Timesheets account for every frame, camerawork directions and sound. After the layout is submitted, a series of checks and corrections is done by either: <br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>Episode Director 演出, Enshutsu </li>
  <li>Director 監督, Kantoku</li>
  <li> Sakuga Director 作画監督, Sakuga Kantoku </li>
  <li> Chief Sakuga Director 総作画監督, Sou Sakuga Kantoku </li>
</ol>
<p> <br> The Chief Sakuga Director is also usually the Character designer and has the final say. </p>

</p>
<h3> 
  GENGA 原画
</h3>
<p> Genga is the Key Animation, where it consists of Layout and Tiedown. The animation work is created in Layout and the corrections are applied and tied-down drawings are made. <br>
<br>The stage when tied-down drawings are made is called Nigen 二元 or Second Key Animation. Nigen is common in busy productions with hectic schedules. Another series of checks will be done, and finally, all the drawings will be collected in the Cut bag カット袋. 
<h3> 
  DOUGA 動画
</h3>
<p> Douga is a common word that means “video” in Japanese. In animation, Douga is the process of drawing the Inbetweens (Nakawari, 中割り) based off the timing charts in the layout. It is finally sent to a Douga checker to make sure the drawings have no errors. The inbetweens complete the Genga and make the final lines in the anime. Douga is usually done in a separate Douga studio. </p>
<h3> 
  SHIAGE 仕上げ
</h3>
<p> Shiage is the Japanese word for finishing or final work. Shiage is when each individual frame is cell-painted according to the color design. </p>
<h3> BIJUTSU (美術) </h3>
<p> The bijutsu, or background department paints backgrounds usually after the Layouts are complete. </p>
<h3> 3DCG </h3>
<p> The 3DCG department generally helps out all other departments when needed. They can create mockups or models to help out animators, create textures or effects for compositors and of course create 3D Animation when needed. </p> 
<h2> POST-PRODUCTION</h2>
<h3> Satsuei 撮影 Compositing </h3>
<p> Compositing is usually done in software like Adobe After Effects. The compositing department will go through all the scenes and polish them into a finished picture. The director works closely with the compositing department. 
</p>
<h3> Henshuu 編集 Editing </h3> 
<p> The finished picture is edited in order and timing is adjusted accordingly into a single piece of footage. Timing is already usually decided at the E-konte stage and this stage usually features minor adjustments. 
</p>
<h3> Afureko アフレコ Voice Recording </h3>
<p> While production is going on, the voice actors are given a script 脚本 and performed in a recording studio. This process is overseen by the Sound Director 音響監督 but can be accompanied by other staff. Recording is either done early in the production, or at the end when the editing is finished. </p>
<h3> Dabingu ダビング Audio Editing</h3>
<p> Audio editing and engineering is done during this process. It is overseen by the sound director and the team of sound engineers. Voices, music and sound effects are all inserted into the footage and mixed. 
</p>
<h3> Kansei 完成 Delivery</h3>
<p> Once all the stages are complete and put together, the anime is complete. Anime airs on a weekly schedule with a season being about 12 episodes long. It takes 3 months for a show to finish airing. Episodes usually air with production still going on.
