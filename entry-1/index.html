<h2> 
  PRE-PRODUCTION
</h2>
  <p>Every animation begins with a concept. A concept can be a director’s original idea compiled in a pitch-package, or an adaption of an existing IP (Manga, Novel, Game, etc) . The pre-production phase consists of planning (Kikaku), scripting (Scenario), design sheets (Settei), and finally storyboards (E-konte). 
 </p>
<div> 
  <h3> 
    <!-- TERMINOLOGY STUFF -->
    KIKAKU 企画 (PLANNING)
  </h3>
  <p> A production committee 制作委員会 is created to facilitate the planning and production of the new anime. The committee is composed of various production companies, broadcasters, publishers, and sponsors. The committee will figure out the scope of the show, the staff and cast, and provide funding. 
</p>
  <h3> 
  SCREENPLAY シナリオ (SCRIPT)  
</h3>
  <p> The screenplay or script is written by a dedicated writer or sometimes the director 監督. There will be plenty of meetings between the directors and writers to perfect the script. Like western scripts, they provide information on place, time, action, movement, etc. 
</p>
  <h3> 
    SETTEI 設定 (DESIGN)
  </h3> 
  <p> Settei is the Japanese term for model sheets or character sheets. Characters, environments, and objects will be drawn on the sheets which will be mass-copied and distributed to animators to use as reference material. The Settei will inform how and what you draw. 
</p> 
<h3> 
  E-konte 絵コンテ (STORYBOARDS)
</h3>
<p> E-konte is the Japanese term referring to storyboards, a visualization of the script. Scenes and movements are drawn out and notes are written. Writers and storyboard artists will work closely together. Storyboard artists can be the director themselves or delegated to Episode directors 演出, who are in charge of individual episodes. <br>
<br> Because E-konte are created by the director or a small team of storyboard artists, they are full of personal style. E-konte are normally messier or rough, because it is drawn fast and expected for animators to give their own interpretations of the scene. Although, some directors like Hayao Miyazaki and Satoshi Kon are renowned for their extremely detailed e-konte. <br>
<br> This is the last part of pre-production. 
</p>

<h2>
  PRODUCTION 
</h2>
<h3>
   LAYOUT レイアウト 
</h3>
<p> 
The layout is the first step to creating Genga 原画 or Key Animation. An animation layout contains the rough animation which is drawn in accordance to the E-konte. Information about camerawork or instructions to compositors are commonly featured on the Layout. The layout also contains a timesheet タイムシート that the animator will fill out. Timesheets account for every frame, camerawork directions and sound. After the layout is submitted, a series of checks and corrections is done by either: <br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>Episode Director 演出, Enshutsu </li>
  <li>Director 監督, Kantoku</li>
  <li> Sakuga Director 作画監督, Sakuga Kantoku </li>
  <li> Chief Sakuga Director 総作画監督, Sou Sakuga Kantoku </li>
</ol>
<p> <br> The Chief Sakuga Director is also usually the Character designer and has the final say. </p>
