        <div class="Border1">Now that we have a general grasp of the Japanese animation pipeline, we can start looking into Sakuga and its integration into the anime fandom. Sakuga refers to a certain kind of way to watch and appreciate animation—the evolution of this appreciation is integral to the anime fandom, motivating and inspiring fans in new ways to enjoy and study the medium. 
        <br> <br>
        This section will look at the birth of sakuga. How, when and why did anime fans start to take an interest in the actual people making the animation? It’s surprisingly straightforward actually. In the early 80s Japan saw the appearance of a new word in anime lingo.  カリスマアニメーター, or karisuma animeta (charisma animator), an animator whose animation isn’t simply good, but stands out to a point where that his style is distinctly recognizable. 
        <br> <br>   
        This figure is represented by one who is considered the most influential and important Japanese animator ever, Yoshinari Kanada. Without getting into too much detail about Kanada (He will be the topic of the next entry!) His animation style with dynamic poses, thick linework, unique timing, and endless creativity made his participation in episodes one of a kind. His work simply stands out so far apart from the rest of the show and TV animation at the time. 
        <br> <br>
        Eventually, Kanada became impossible to ignore. His individual style would continue popping up in outstanding episodes and fans would look up the credits and realize that his name kept coming up.
